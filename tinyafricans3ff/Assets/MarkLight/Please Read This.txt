====  Introduction  ==============================================================

MarkLight is framework for Unity that empowers developers and designers to 
create components that can be combined, shared, extended, styled and plugged 
into different projects.

MarkLight offers a markup design language (like HTML/XAML) that can be used to 
express views and their relationship to the underlying game logic. Views are 
modular building blocks that can represent anything in the scene (UI widgets, 
meshes, lights, etc).


====  Upgrading from earlier versions  ===========================================

Backup your project. Remove the MarkLight folder and import the new package. 
For easy upgrade in the future keep your custom views and themes in a folder 
outside the /MarkLight folder (e.g. in the folder /Views at the project root).


====  Package Details  ===========================================================

(required)
MarkLight\Configuration\* .............. Configuration asset
MarkLight\Source\* ..................... Framework API
MarkLight\Themes\* ..................... Assets files for the themes
MarkLight\Views\* ...................... Framework views

====  Documentation  =============================================================

Please check out http://www.marklightforunity.com for the most up to date versions 
of the API docs and tutorials. If it's your first time using MarkLight I recommend 
you read through the Getting Started guide at:

====  How to get intellisense in XUML (highly recommended)  ======================

Here are instructions to get intellisense in Visual Studio when editing XUML. 

1. Navigate to the Visual Studio schema cache folder, e.g:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Xml\Schemas

2. Edit catalog.xml and add the following entry:

<Schema targetNamespace="MarkLight" href="C:/<PathToYourProject>/Assets/MarkLight/Views/Schemas/MarkLight.xsd"/>

Add it next to the other schema entries and replace <PathToYourProject> with the 
path to your project.

NOTE: If you are denied access while saving the file you can copy the file, edit it 
and copy it back to the folder being asked to do so with administrator authorization.

3. If you've added your own custom views and want intellisense for them you can update
the schema file by clicking "Generate Schema" on your view presenter.

4. Add a namespace attribute (xmlns) to your XUML root element, e.g. in YourView.xml:

<YourView xmlns="MarkLight">


====  Serialization errors when importing asset  =================================

If you use a non-default asset serialization mode (like Force Text) you might get
errors while importing the asset. This will show up as console errors with long 
numbers like:

[MarkLight] 53686f77636173655f546f6f6e5468656d65: Field "5769647468" missing for field change handler "5570646174654c61796f757473".

This is an issue with the Unity editor failing to convert the imported assets to 
the right serialization mode. To fix this you need to switch back and forth between
serialization modes (Edit->Project Settings->Editor) which will cause the editor to 
convert the project assets to the right format.


====  `Linq' does not exist in the namespace `System.Xml'  =======================

If you get this error you need to switch platform at File -> Build settings ...
from Web Player to a platform officially supported (PC, WebGL, Android, iOS, etc).
